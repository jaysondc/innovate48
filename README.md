## Solution Name

MBanking AR

## Describe your solution; What problem you are solving

Another way to authenticate and view our Mobile Banking Product with the latest technology offered by the hi tech companies such as Google and Apple.

Modernize the end-user experience to interact with their mobile banking apps by leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology. Using augmented reality in banking can not only increase the efficiency of certain operations but also enhance the overall user experience.

## Solution Features

This prototype scans the credit card, and overlays the card balance, recent transactions, and the rewards information in the AR view.

It uses the LensStudio's animation and rendering technology to overlay the card information.

For the purpose of this demo, we are simulating the code connect card APIs responses to display the card data.

Consumers use his/her phone on accessing banking/financial data from the financial institutiions.

## What your code was written in

Javascript and LensStudio for phototyping.  Kotlin and Swift for the future development.

## Open source or proprietary software used (if applicable)

No open source.  All proprietary.

## Why it's cool

It is never been done inside FIS.


## What’s your WoW factor?

Augmented Reality enable users to undergo an immersive, interactive experience where reality is “augmented” and enriched with computer-generated data, images, and sounds.

It is just beyond people's imagination and no leading Financial mobile app provider has such product in the market. Just imagining the banks have virtual branches - replacing physical brick-mortar locations.
